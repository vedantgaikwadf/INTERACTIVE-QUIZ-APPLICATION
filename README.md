Project Description

The Interactive Quiz Application is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to test their knowledge through multiple-choice quizzes. The application is designed to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience with dynamic content loading, real-time feedback, and score tracking.

The quiz begins with a topic selection screen, where users can choose from different quiz categories such as JavaScript, C Programming, and General Knowledge. Based on the selected topic, questions are dynamically loaded from JavaScript data structures, ensuring flexibility and scalability without modifying the HTML structure.

Each quiz question is displayed with four multiple-choice options, and users receive instant feedback after selecting an answer. Correct answers are highlighted in green, while incorrect selections are shown in red, helping users immediately understand their performance. The application maintains a live score counter and displays the current question number to track progress.

An animated progress bar visually represents quiz completion, enhancing user engagement and providing clear progress indication throughout the quiz. Navigation controls such as Next Question, Back to Topics, and Restart Quiz buttons allow smooth movement between different stages of the application without page reloads.

At the end of the quiz, a result screen displays the user’s final score in a clear and concise format. The interface is styled using modern CSS techniques, including flexbox layouts, hover effects, transitions, and responsive design principles to ensure a polished and consistent appearance across devices.
